# DerbyHacks2

This project was made at the University of Louisville's Derby Hacks 2 over the weekend of February 24th - 26th. The team members Ryan and Jacob borrowed a dollhouse from a friend and hacked it into a Barbie Smart Home. They installed light modules, a fire alarm, door locks, a working elevator, and a webcam (street cam), adding some very real curb appeal from all the new tech. The modules are controlled by two Raspberry Pis, and an Arduino. Both Pis are controlled by a web application the guys built called SmartDollHouse (soon to be located at smartdollhouse.me). Using some PHP and bootstrap to make it pretty, they made an interactive website that would control the house functions through button clicks.
Not all of us are plastic, but we all deserve to live in a world (and house) that is fantastic.
